# fe-take-home

Objective: Build a simple login & dashboard screen for a SaaS platform for small FMCG brands.
Note: You should have access to the Visily designs. The PDF in this repo is just for quick reference. If you do not have the original Visily board, please contact us for access. 

Requirements:
* The application should be responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile.
* The application should be built with React, using Typescript
* Include error handling for incorrect login details
* Hard code data, and a simple set of login details to access the dashboard (i.e. email: "admin@gmail.com" password: "admin")
* Write a short README file explaining how to run your application, and any decisions or assumptions you made during the development.
* You may, if you like, use a component library of your choice (optional) 

Bonus:

* Use an atomic state management solution (storing login state for example) 
* Smooth animations and attention for detail
* Other ideas to improve UI/UX of your own, if you have any, are welcome

Submission:

Please host your code on a public repository on GitHub and deploy the application on a free hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

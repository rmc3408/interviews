Hello XXXXX Team,

I would like to apply for the Full Stack Engineer position because I have 4 years of full-time work experience in ALL technologies required. Also, I have experience as Dev Team leader to coach new devs, organize project in tasks and ensure following a calendar to delivery good user experience in the timeline.

Currently, at FlowFactor, I have being creating an amazing web portal in Angular with Chat (AI model) . The backend was using LLM for chat and storer in private data and provided a specific PubMed database to get high quality reports. In my last 4 years, I Â have performed activities by implementing new features from designing new clean React, Angular (or other languages) architecture and the endpoints from backend (using NodeJS/Express) in sync to keeping it scalable, maintainable and well-tested by unit testing. Mostly task were involved performing many refactoring in several backend languages (.NET, Python, Typescript) to solve any issues of performance and automation in order to reduce costs.

I am Canadian citizen which I do not need sponsor visa, I can have TN-VISA just with contract. I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss my skills with you.

Best regards,
Raphael Molinaro

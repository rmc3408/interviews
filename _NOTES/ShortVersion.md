I would like to apply for the Software Engineer role because I have 3-4 years of full-time work experience as a Full Stack Developer including React, MySQL, Python, AWS, and Docker (willing to grasp a deep knowledge in Spring Boot).Â 

My previous experience consists of making Figma designs to be implemented to great user experience via React, using easy scalable and maintainable API (built in several languages, mostly Node and Python) as well as both architectures always optimized performance and well-tested before deployment. Certainly, I would love to participate in AI algorithms.

I would like to apply for the Backend role because I have 3 years of full-time work experience as a Software Developer. The last 2 years, I have majority working on backend including MongoDB, NestJs (node framework), Swagger, Redis, AWS, and Docker. 

My previous experience performed many refactoring in several backend languages (Typescript) to solve any issues of performance and automation to reduce costs in cloud platforms.  At Warner Media (paid by REDSPace consulting), I have been using node.js to build servers, creating SDK, refactoring transport formats (REST, GraphQL or gRPC) and also, I debuged many issues of performance and unit test automation.

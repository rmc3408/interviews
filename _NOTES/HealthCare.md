Hello XXXXXX Team,

I would love to apply for the XXXXX role  because I have 3 years of full-time work experience as Full Stack Developer in ALL technologies required in the job posting including XXXXX. I have previous experience in startup in healthcare, 5 years of work after my PhD in medical science and lots of passion for healthcare. 
  
In my last 4 years, I  have performed activities by implementing new features from designing new clean React, Angular (or other languages) architecture and the endpoints from backend (using NodeJS/Express) in sync to keeping it scalable, maintainable and well-tested by unit testing.  Currently, at FlowFactor, I have being creating an amazing web portal in Angular with Chat (AI model) focus on Pubmed database to get high quality reports. All those tasks I already successfully implemented to connect patient-doctors in the safety environment following regulation and compliances in Canada. Previously, At WarnerMedia, I developed an app implemented in several groups such as CNN, TBS, HBO. All processes required many refactoring in several backend languages (.NET, Python, Typescript) using API formats such as RESTfull, GraphQL or gRPC.

Noteworthy, I do not require sponsorship in the future since I am a Canadian Citizen who resides in Toronto which is a perfect scenario for an on-site or remote environment.  Please, don't hesitate to contact me at molinaro.raphael@gmail.com or +1(647) 838-9921 and I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss my skills with you.

Best regards,
Raphael

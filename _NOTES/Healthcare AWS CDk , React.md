I have 4 years of full-time work experience as a Software Developer in technologies React, typescript, Node, AWS CDK (lambda layers, DynamoDB), PostgreSQL, GraphQL queries and docker. The last year, I have experience as Dev Team leader to coach new devs, organize project in tasks and ensure following a calendar to delivery good user experience in the timeline.

I have passion for healthcare, my previous experience in healthcare startups and my academic career in Medical Science Field. At Large company like Warner Media (paid by REDSpace consulting), I have been using node.js to build servers, creating CDK, refactoring transport formats (REST, GraphQL or gRPC) and also, I debugged many issues of performance and unit test automation.

Hello XXXXX,


I applied for Full Stack position. I am perfect fit for this role, I have 4 years of full-time work experience in ALL technologies required and implementing AI to improve and recommendation based on PubMed. Indeed, my previous experience in 2 healthcare startup, PhD in medical science and Dev Team leader experience make me the best candidate.

  

The last year, I have experience as Dev Team leader to coach new devs, organize project in tasks and ensure following a calendar to delivery good user experience in the timeline. At FlowFactor, I have being creating an amazing web portal in React/Angular with Chat (AI model) . The backend was using LLM for chat and storer in private data and provided a specific PubMed database to get high quality reports. As result, I successfully implemented video call conferences and text messaging systems to connect patient-doctors in the safety environment following regulation and compliances in Canada.

  

In my previous workplaces, I developed an React/ Angular features such as 3rd party app, videoconference, web portal, business data visualization/analizys, authentication, messaging and connected microservices via cloud services in several departments such as CNN, TBS, HBO. All processes required many refactoring in several backend languages (FastAPI and NodeJS) using API formats such as RESTfull, GraphQL or gRPC. Also, I performed many refactoring in several backend languages (Python, Typescript) to solve any issues of performance and automation in order to reduce costs.

  

I am Canadian citizen living in Toronto. I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss my skills with you.

  

Best regards,

Raphael Molinaro

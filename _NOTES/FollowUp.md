I recently applied, and you downloaded my resume. I want to express my high interest in learning and inform you I have experience in optimizing components by refactoring to make them smaller and faster. In my previous experience, I designed and developed React-based applications to run on Web, Mobile (React Native), Android TV and Apple TV apps. Even though I do not have many years, I have 3 years of solid experience, am proactive, kind and self-learner and am greatly willing to make good products for client satisfaction.

Indeed, I am capable of bringing solutions to any React project and performed many refactoring in several backend languages (.NET, Python, Typescript) to solve any issues of performance and automation to reduce costs in cloud platforms.

More than my tech skills, I was a team leader of 5 developers, successfully learning/mentoring students, code reviewing and sharing presentations in startups, large companies such as WarnerMedia or during my doctoral degree with developers and non-technical clients by documentation, great user experience and client satisfaction. As proof of my commitment, I can provide you with reference letters from my Tech Team Leader, manager and others.

Noteworthy, I do not require sponsorship in the future since I am a Canadian Citizen who resides in Toronto which is a perfect scenario for an on-site or remote environment.Â  Please, don't hesitate to contact me at molinaro.raphael@gmail.com or +1(647) 838-9921 I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss my skills with you.

Best regards,
Raphael Molinaro

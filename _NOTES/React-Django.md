Hello XXXX Team,

I have 4 years of full-time work experience as Full Stack Developer in ALL technologies required in the job posting including Python Django, and React, Node.js. Also, I have experience as Dev Team leader to coach new devs, organize project in tasks and ensure following a calendar to delivery good user experience in the timeline.

In my last 4 years, I  have performed many activities by implementing new features from designing new clean UI in React (or other languages as Django) architecture and the endpoints from backend (using Django-REST-Flask or NodeJS/Express) in sync to keeping it scalable, maintainable and well-tested by unit testing. During my previous work, I successfully integrated several third-party systems such as calendar, authentication, dashboards, video call, WebSocket text messaging and microservices systems to connect users in the safety environment following regulation and compliances in Canada. At Warner Media, I did bring solutions to any React, Next.JS projects and performed many refactoring in several backend languages (Python, Typescript) to solve any issues of performance and automation of APIs in order to reduce costs in cloud services as AWS or Azure in containers via docker.

As part of my learning experience, a few months ago I created a collaborative project where I was a team leader of 5 developers to gain experience in which all projects are available on my GitHub in continuous learning, a positive and proactive attitude, and take ownership to deliver any project. Indeed, this successful mentoring skill was developed from several years (10+) of experience in the Medical Science academic field. In summary, my previous experiences in those industry also includes work independently with minimal supervision and good in team collaboration and sharing knowledge with developers and non-technical clients by documentation, great user experience and client satisfaction. As proof of my commitment, I can provide you with reference letters from my Tech Team Leader, manager and others.  
  
Noteworthy, I do not require sponsorship in the future since I am a Canadian Citizen who resides in Toronto which is a perfect scenario for an on-site or remote environment.  Please, don't hesitate to contact me at  [molinaro.raphael@gmail.com](molinaro.raphael@gmail.com) or +1(647) 838-9921 and I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss my skills with you.


Best regards,

Hello XXXXX Team,

I would like to apply for the Software Engineer position because I have a total of 5 years as a Developer and 3 years of Full Time work experience as Full Stack Developer in ALL technologies required in the job posting including XXXXX, and XXXX. Also, I have experience in startups in the XXXX industry. Indeed, all those experiences confirm that I am very proactive and take ownership of my project. Noteworthy, I have several years (10+) of experience in continuous and fast learning, a positive attitude, and a love for mentoring and solving any technical problem-solving skills developed during my Ph.D. degree. Finally, I do not require sponsorship in the future since I am a Canadian Citizen who resides in Toronto. 

As proof of my coding experience and my communication skills, I can provide you with reference letters from my Tech Team Leader, manager and senior co-worker. Even though I do not have exactly XXXX years of experience.

I am very interested in participating in your company and it is also a perfect scenario for my professional growth. Please, don't hesitate to contact me.


Best regards,
Raphael Molinaro

Hello XXXXX,

I would like to apply for the Full Stack Engineer role because I have 3 years of full-time work experience as Full Stack Developer in object-oriented programming in C# .NET, Java, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, (HTML 5, React or AngularJS) and Python-Django.

Indeed, I have designed, performed, optimized and validated platform applications using GUI following Canadian compliances defined by the Government. All process and UI elements were extensively tested by regression, manually and automated and debugged to ensure to reduce cost and issues.

Noteworthy, I am a Canadian Citizen with security clearance at the reliability status. I hold a doctorate degree in Science. As proof of my commitment, I can provide you with reference letters from my Tech Team Leader, manager and more.

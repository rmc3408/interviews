To XXXX Team,

I would like to apply for the Full Stack developer position. I have 4 years of full-time work experience inclusive experience as Dev Team leader to coach new devs, organize project in tasks and ensure following a calendar to delivery good user experience in the timeline.

During last 4 years, I performed several task and exceed all expectation of my leaders. I have performed activities by implementing new features using Javascript frameworks or ASP.NET MVC architecture in the front end and RESTful API endpoints using .NET. or several other backend languages (Python, Typescript) to solve any issues of performance and automation in order to reduce costs, reviewed user stories, wrote ticket and break down with time estimates.

As part of my learning experience, a few months ago I created a collaborative project where I was a team leader of 5 developers to gain experience in which all projects are available on my GitHub in continuous learning, a positive and proactive attitude, and take ownership to deliver any project. Indeed, this successful mentoring skill was developed from several years (10+) of experience in the Medical Science academic field. In summary, my previous experiences in those industry also includes better team collaboration and sharing knowledge with developers and non-technical clients by documentation, great user experience and client satisfaction. As proof of my commitment, I can provide you with reference letters from my Tech Team Leader, manager and others.  

Noteworthy, I do not require sponsorship in the future since I am a Canadian Citizen with Reliability Security Clearance.  Please, don't hesitate to contact me at molinaro.raphael@gmail.com or +1(647) 838-9921 and I look forward to having the opportunity to discuss my skills with you.


Best regards,
Raphael Molinaro

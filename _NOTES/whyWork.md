It is with great interest that I would like to apply because I read/heard good points about company's culture, health workplace and foster developer's career growth. I think I will be valuable and strong asset to Secoda since my 5 years of developer experience, team leader and product manager experience plus more than 10 year in academic field. All those points, it made a candidate proactive (self-starter) and high engage to bring team together to drive any mission forward.
